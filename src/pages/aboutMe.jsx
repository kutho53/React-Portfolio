            I'm a recent graduate of UNC-Chapel Hill's Software Development program with a passion for building practical, efficient, and user-focused solutions. My journey into software development began after earning a bachelor's degree in Business and working hands-on as a Marine Corps aviation technicianâ€”an experience that shaped my attention to detail, problem-solving mindset, and commitment to precision under pressure.

            Transitioning into tech felt like a natural evolution. I enjoy breaking down complex challenges and crafting clean, functional code that brings ideas to life. My background gives me a unique perspective: I understand both the technical and business sides of a project, and I thrive in environments where collaboration, adaptability, and continuous learning are key.

            Whether I'm writing JavaScript, exploring back-end frameworks, or diving into a new tool, I'm driven by curiosity and a desire to make meaningful contributions to every team I'm a part of.
